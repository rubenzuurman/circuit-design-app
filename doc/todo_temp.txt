mechanic for recursively executing SimObjects
	- in simulation.py: get all objects with no outputs
	- call function on every one of these objects which:
		- gets the input locations list
		- check if the objects which contain the necessary values have been evaluated
		- if they have:
			- call execute_logic() on the original object
		- if they haven't
			- call this function on the object which contains the necessary value
